# AI-Image-Differntiation

This project investigates the performance of various classification models in
the context of image classification tasks. We explore traditional approaches such as
logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), alongside advanced
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like MobileNetV2 and ReXNet_150. Through
extensive experimentation and evaluation on a given dataset, we compare the
accuracy and efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal the superior
performance of CNN architectures, particularly MobileNetV2 and ReXNet_150, in
achieving high accuracy in image classification tasks. Furthermore, we discuss
potential avenues for future research, including model refinement, task expansion,
and real-world deployment, to enhance the project's applicability and impact.
